Returns

Hi Team,

I recently purchased an item from an online store which I was unable to return due to inaccurate and missing information both on the company’s website and when contacting their customer service team.

The company’s I am referring to is farfetch.com. The returns section of their website provides details around returning an item via a drop-off location. Most or all of the locations listed on their website however either no longer exist or no longer provide the drop-off service. 

The site also provides a link to the drop-off provider itself which is Doddle. When I took the item into one of the locations with the return form I was told that it was not acceptable as it was missing the identifier they use to track. Upon visiting the doddle select retailer link you can see that farfetch is not included in their list of supported retailers therefore it is not possible to generate such an identifier.

The return section for farfetch can be found at the below link
https://farfetch.com/uk/click-and-collect
(see DODDLE LOCATIONS for the missing locations)

The link to doddle is below
Farfetch Doddle page - https://www.doddle.com/shopping/farfetch

The list of supported doddle retailers (farfetch not included)
https://www.doddle.com/return/select-retailer/

Thirdly on calling their customer service line I was told that another drop-off option DPL was available however there was no mention of this on the company’s website and by this point I was also told that the return period had expired.

I have attached email correspondence between myself and farfetch.

Could you suggest the best way to return the item in light of the above

Kind Regards,
Cameron
